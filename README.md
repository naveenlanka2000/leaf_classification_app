# Leaf Classification App

This project demonstrates a minimal web application for classifying plant
leaves using a TensorFlow model.  Users can upload a photo of a leaf and the
application will return the predicted class and a confidence score.

## Running the application

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` and upload an image to receive a
prediction.  The bundled model is a small demo and should be replaced with your
own model for realâ€‘world usage.
